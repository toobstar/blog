It seems bizarre to me that Markdown is more popular now than ever.  How did this happen?  It seems quite primitive that you'd write *italics* in this way:

```markdown
*italics*
```

but on reflection before (ascii) emojis emphasising text with astericks did seem a common place thing to do. 

The first time I paid any attention to Markdown came via [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/is-html-a-humane-markup-language/) and his efforts to use Markdown in this new [developer website](http://stackoverflow.com) he and Joel Spolsky were creating.  This caused some [controversy](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ajj7k/jeff_atwood_calls_out_markdown_creator_john/) at the time.

The [project](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) was created by Josh Gruber and it's impressive to note that not much has changed since then despite this open invitation from the author:

> Itâ€™s my hope that [the mailing list](https://pairlist6.pair.net/pipermail/markdown-discuss/) will lead to good ideas for future improvements to Markdown.  

Anyway - here we are and it's now more broadly used than ever and has become the defactor standard for entering lightly decorated text into a website form.  There are various extensions, work-arounds and [hacks](https://www.markdownguide.org/hacks/) but these aren't things I care about greatly.

In my case it's also become part of an [interesting pattern to create static websites](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/vcaku9/basic_blog_based_on_static_markdown_files/). There are a bunch of libraries now that allow blogs like this to be published on static hosting platforms such as GitHub.  There are also many clients for writing Markdown which make it simple to work with. 

Very cool!
