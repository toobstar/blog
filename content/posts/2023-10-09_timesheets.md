A business has various constraints around how it develops and delivers services.  For most businesses the primary cost and enabler of success are the people who are engaged to work for it.    

In order to understand the dynamics of a business you can start with (and go quite far) simply knowing the roles of the team and the organisational structure that they sit within.  For most growing or dynamic businesses each individual will typically be working towards multiple goals and this level of precision is not sufficient to understand it adequately. 

Whether it's enabling business operations, accounting, or fund-raising there are many metrics that are commonly used to understand a business.  These will focus on either the cost side, the revenue side, or some ratio between the two.  Commons examples include: 

- monthly or annual recurring revenue (MRR / ARR) 
- gross or net profit margin 
- the cost of acquiring a customer (CAC)
- the average duration it takes to "pay back" the customer acquistion costs 

These well known metrics are preferred because there are industry expectations for each and having an easy method for comparison is highly desirable for understanding the good and the bad. 

A rough mental model is that costs in a business are either fixed or variable.  Whereas a fixed cost 

The reason their distinction is important is that one grows *more* linearly with revenue whereas the other is *more* stable in relation to revenue.  In order to understand the growth potential or prospects of a business the dynamics between costs and revenue are required to be understood.  

A traditional view of this is to split work done within a company between:
- general and administrative work (G&A)
- sales
- service delivery (COGS)

It is generally expected that G&A is a relatively fixed cost, and sales-COGS are relatively variable.  , but ideally leveraged such that there is a highly scalable growth potential.  In a course grained view of this a consulting business can typically 2x the cost of it's COGS as revenue, whereas a product business can 10x it's COGS as revenue.   


In order to work these out you need to understand where the team across the company work.
