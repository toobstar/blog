Why does any business do timesheets which are notoriously unpopular and hard to do well?
- in order to understand business dynamics
- to bill for time spent on an agreed task
- to understand velocity to complete a task so future work can be better planned out (i.e. filling a pipeline more optimally)

In all 3 cases it's important to be deliberate about whether we are tracking the cost to the business (e.g. the overall cost of an employee) versus some external representation of the value delivered by that person's work (e.g. an hourly rate for an employee multiplied by hours spent).  Language used to navigate this includes the effective rate, or billable hours, or utilisation of an individual but it basically comes down to the same concern. 

If the decision is made to track the cost to the business (and assuming no overtime is paid which is typical in my experience) it's simpler to consider that as a percentage of a whole day.  E.g. 25% or 50% of a day. Where the external representation is required then hours or minutes can be used, but this requires more work for those entering their time, which can reduce data-quality if not done properly.

Note: it's almost impossible to track both types of time spent at the same time.  A more reasonable solution is some translation as required between the two approaches. 

## Understanding Business Dynamics

A business has many constraints around how it develops, sells and delivers services.  These constraints might include access to input materials, or marketing budgets, or many other things, but **for most businesses the primary cost and enabler of success are the people who are engaged to work for it**.    

In order to understand the dynamics of a business you can start with (and go quite far) simply knowing the roles of the team and the organisational structure that they sit within.  For most growing or dynamic businesses each individual will typically be working towards multiple goals and this level of precision is not sufficient to understand it adequately. 

A basic mental model for costs in a business is that some costs are fairly stable and some costs are dynamic and depend on a variable that may or may not be directly connected to revenue.  As an example for a company that processes data, large amounts of data are more expensive to process than small amounts of data all else being equal.  Or for a business where a person is required to close a sale, the cost of sales overall is highly variable and tied to the cost of people to fulfil this. 

The reason this distinction is important is that in order to understand the growth potential of a business these dynamics between costs and revenue are required to be understood.  

A standard breakdown of employee time is to split work done between:
- general and administrative work (G&A)
- sales
- service delivery (COGS)

It is generally expected that G&A is a relatively fixed cost, whereas sales and service delivery are relatively variable.  Businesses that are dependent on people for sales and service delivery (such as consulting companies) are constrained in how much growth they can achieve, whereas business that can automate sales and service delivery have much higher growth potential.  

A general benchmark for gross profit margin for professional services businesses is around 30%.  Internet based product companies are expected to have a higher growth margin based on the level of automation and scale than can be achieved.

## Billable Time 

Some professions have billable time and an optimal timesheeting solution for them is quite different than that of *regular* companies. From a technical point of view it's a much simpler implementation to assume that every minute of the day is accounted for and not have to complicate things further than that. 

## Practical Concerns and Tips

#### How to treat administrative or leave time?

#### Multi-national companies with different working week counts

#### What to do when it's not known how to categorise a task 

Account management, that becomes support, that is actually product development, which then requires a release to resolve, and becomes part of a sales strategy to drive renewal.
