A business has various constraints around how it develops and delivers services.  This includes the tools it has access to or input materials or regulatory environment it works within.  But for most businesses the primary cost and enabler of success are the people who are employed by the business.    

In order to understand the dynamics of a business you can start with (and go quite far) simply knowing the roles of the employees and the organisational structure they sit within.  But for most growing or dynamic businesses each individual will typically be working towards multiple goals and this level of precision is not sufficient to understand it adequately. 

Whether it's enabling business operations, accounting, or fund-raising there are many metrics that are commonly used to understand a business.  These will focus on either the cost side, the revenue side, or some ratio between the two.  Commons examples include: 

- monthly or annual recurring revenue (MRR / ARR) 
- profit margin 
- the cost of acquiring a customer (CAC)
- the average duration it takes to "pay back" the CAC

These well known metrics are preferred because there are industry expectations for good and bad and having an easy method for comparison is highly desirable. 

Fundamentally costs can be allocated as fixed or variable, and the reason their distinction is important is that one grows *more* linearly with revenue whereas the other is *more* stable in relation to revenue.  In order to understand the growth potential or prospects of a business the dynamics between costs and revenue as the business evolves are required to be understood.  

A traditional view of this is to split work done within a company between:
- general / administrative work (G&A)
- sales
- service delivery (COGS)

Where it is generally expected that G&A is a relatively fixed cost, and Sales/COGS are relatively variable, but ideally leveraged such that there is a highly scalable growth potential.  In a course grained view of this a consulting business can typically 2x the cost of it's COGS as revenue, whereas a product business can 10x it's COGS as revenue.   


In order to work these out you need to understand where the team across the company work.
