There are both internal and external requirements to have clarity around a business and these include compliance (e.g. accounting), fund-raising (e.g. venture capital) or for internal operations through the executive and leadership teams.  In order to do this effectively there are many metrics that are used.  These will focus on either the cost side, the revenue side, or some ratio between the two.  Common examples include: 

- monthly / annual recurring revenue (MRR / ARR) 
- gross / net profit margin 
- the cost of acquiring a customer (CAC)
- the average duration it takes to "pay back" the customer acquistion costs 
- revenue per employee (RPE)

These well known metrics are preferred because there are industry expectations for each and having an easy method for comparison is highly desirable for understanding performance.
